(Jumping currently behaves like some kind of crazy jetpack üë®‚ÄçüöÄ - it very much shouldn\u0026rsquo;t)\nThis was due to me clamping each axis separately to within the max speed limits.\nx = float.Clamp(x, -MaxHorizontalSpeed, MaxHorizontalSpeed); z = float.Clamp(z, -MaxHorizontalSpeed, MaxHorizontalSpeed); This had the effect of keeping one axis below the speed limit, but allowing the other to continue to accelerate. Now I validate against the length of the vector rather than the individual axes.\nAs you can see from the screenshot I\u0026rsquo;m also now playing around with some different block arrangements to try and find any weird edge cases with the collision detection.\nI think I need to add a small offset when resolving intersections to avoid collisions with block seams but need to find a reproducible test case first.\n","date":"30 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/playing/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Playing and fixing","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"30 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"Not quite a game, but a here\u0026rsquo;s a game-like-thing I made nonetheless.\n\u0026nbsp;Download v0.1.0-alpha C#, .NET 8, fully custom engine.\nVery small number of only essential libraries used.\n","date":"28 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/rise/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"We make games","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
