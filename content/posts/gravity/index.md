Who knew realism was so hard to program?  

Meanwhile I took a few days to visit friends. Now working on world interaction.
So started with block picking which needs a way to query live block info.
That means I'm looking into block and chunk storage techniques.
Will probably end up with a sort of live (narrow) grid of chunks which exists around the player
and is updated as you traverse chunk boundaries. Not sure how to handle the actual loading and
generating of chunks when this happens. I may need to separate the two quite strictly.
